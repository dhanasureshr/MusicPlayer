// Assuming you have an instance of PlayerListManager somewhere in your Java code
PlayerListManager playerListManager = new PlayerListManager();

// Assuming playNextList is a List<String> containing the file paths
List<String> playNextList = new ArrayList<>();
playNextList.add("path/to/next/song1.mp3");
playNextList.add("path/to/next/song2.mp3");

// Convert List<String> to String[]
String[] playNextArray = playNextList.toArray(new String[0]);

// Call the nativePlayNext function
playerListManager.nativePlayNext(playNextArray);
